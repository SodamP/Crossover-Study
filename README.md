# Cross-Over Study
In the class of 'Design Experiments', there was an opportunity to design experiments and present the results.
Therefore, the experiment comparing premium cosmetics and road shop cosmetics was analyzed by applying cross study.
It was 2 by 2 crossover design, and it created a 2*2 crossover study function. In addition, when analyzing in a nonparametric way, we use the 'sanon' package.

NOTE: Because it was a very personal experiment, the results may vary from person to person.
